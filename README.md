# MultiMino-Project
"A block falling game made with love"

Hello everyone.

Finally after so long I made public the source code of MultiMino while I'm
developing its sequel, I've figured that it doesn't make a lot of a difference
waiting until M2 is released than just releasing it now, which
translates to just sharing the project file for you to take a look. This
game means a lot to me and despite not planning to update it anymore I
think that maybe someone can find a use to it after inspecting the code.

This game was a learning curve for me, so please don't expect amazing code. 
Things could've been a lot better and way smoother than they are on its final
release.

# Opening the project

- Download the folder and drag it to C:\Users\ [Your User] \Documents\GameMakerStudio2
- Start Game Maker Studio 2
- Select Load and open Multimino.yyp
- That's it!!

Thank you so much for everything, your support means a lot for me.
